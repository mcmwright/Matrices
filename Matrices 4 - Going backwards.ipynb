    "The concepts introduced in this and the previous notebooks generalise directly to the $N$-dimensional case, as long as the matrices are still square. Whereas in two dimensions a singular matrix is  a special case that you might consider yourself unlucky to have come across, when the number of dimensions reaches the hundreds or thousands then a full-rank (i.e. non-singular) matrix may (depending on context) become unlikely and elusive. And as we'll see later, a matrix might be technically non-singular but in reality so close to singular that it might as well be. Bear in mind also that in many cases the elements may arise from measured data and will have a certain degree of uncertainty associated with them. "
