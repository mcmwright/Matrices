    "In this notebook we're going to interpret $2\\times 1$ vectors as the co-ordinates of points on the Cartesian plane, that is, an ordinary set of $x$--$y$ axes. We're going to look at the effect of multiplying such vectors by $2\\times 2$ matrices. Looking at one point at a time won't tell us much so we'll use a few points to draw a picture and see what happens to it when all its points are *transformed* by the matrix. In this context the vectors are nouns and the matrices are verbs. We'll sometimes refer to the result of a transformation as the *image* of the original figure under the transformation *induced* by the matrix.\n"

We've only calculated where the discrete points went to, and then joined them up with straight lines, implicitly assuming that the image of every point on the line between two end-points  will move to a position on the line between the images of the end-points. In other words we've assumed that co-linear sets of points will remain co-linear. Looking at our dog transformed by $\\mathbf{H}$ or $\\mathbf{F}$ we can see that at least in these cases the three co-linear points on the right-hand edge of the dog  remained co-linear under these transformations. Would that still be true for those three points whatever matrix was used? \n",
