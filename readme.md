# Matrices
## M C M Wright, ISVR, University of Southampton
These notebooks provide an idiosycratic introduction to matrices, using the geometric transformations 
induced by 2x2 matrices to illustrate and motivate more general behaviour. This approach is partly
imspired by the Midlands Mathematics Experiment textbooks I was taught with at High School, and
by my subsequent experiences teaching Acoustical Engineering students at the Institute of
Sound and Vibration Research at the University of Southampton. 

They are, naturally, both incomplete and unfinishesed - I intend to say more about vibrating systems 
and then perhaps go on to probability transition matrices. I'd like to explain better why a matric
whose columns are eigenvectors induces the appropriate change of axes. But for now I know that at
least some students have found them helpful.
