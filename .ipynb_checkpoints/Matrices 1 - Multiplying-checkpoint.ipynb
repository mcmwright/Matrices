Wherever possible we'll try to relate mathematical results to geometrical behaviour that we can plot and observe.

The reason is that in cases like this NumPy automatically *broadcasts* the lower-dimensional array by filling an array of the required size with copies of it. So in the cell above, NumPy multiplied the corresponding elements of the following arrays (written with brackets instead of parentheses to show that they're not being treated as matrices)\n",
